## Troubleshooting

### If your logo still doesn't appear:
- Make sure the logo file is in the `assets` folder
- Check that all HTML files reference the logo with the correct path: `assets/InfernoMach_Company_Logo.png`

### If contact form doesn't work:
- Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
- Create a new form and get your form ID
- Update the form action in index.html to: `action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID"`

Your website should now be live at a URL like: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
